/* What each pool entry is worth to this machine per cell it occupies, used to decide which modules the fill is offered
 * Board space is the scarce resource, so per-cell is the comparison that matters
 *
 * These weights are not the placement weights, and the difference is the point
 * The score pays nothing for overshooting a target, so once a target is met, another point of that stat is worth next to nothing for a stat that is only being held to a target
 * A machine sitting comfortably above P 500 and Q 150 should be offered Efficiency modules, not more of what it already has
 * The placement heuristic keeps the full target weight in every case, and that is what stops a met target being undercut. This only decides what gets offered to it
 *
 * Which targets are met changes as the board moves, so there is one table per combination of met targets (at most eight), built once here, picked by bitmask per fill
 * Rebuilding a table whenever the totals shifted would cost more than the bias is worth
 *
 * The draw only ever asks which of two entries is worth more, so each table holds the rank of the entry's value rather than the value itself
